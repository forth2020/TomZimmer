<H2>A.8 The optional Double-Number word set</H2>

Forth systems on 8-bit and 16-bit processors often find it necessary to
deal with double-length numbers.  But many Forths on small embedded
systems do not, and many users of Forth on systems with a cell size of
32-bits or more find that the necessity for double-length numbers is
much diminished.  Therefore, we have factored the words that manipulate
double-length entities into this optional word set.

<P>

Please note that the naming convention used in this word set conveys
some important information:

<P>

1.  Words whose names are of the form 2xxx deal with cell pairs, where
the relationship between the cells is unspecified.  They may be
two-vectors, double-length numbers, or any pair of cells that it is
convenient to manipulate together.

<P>

2.  Words with names of the form Dxxx deal specifically with
double-length integers.

<P>

3.  Words with names of the form Mxxx deal with some combination of
single and double integers.  The order in which these appear on the
stack is determined by long-standing common practice.

There exist number representations, e.g., the sign-magnitude
representation, where reduction from double- to single-precision cannot
simply be done with 
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.1260>DROP</a>.  
This word, equivalent to DROP on two's
complement systems, desensitizes application code to number
representation and facilitates portability.

<a name=A.8.6.1.1820>A.8.6.1.1820 M*/</A>
<P>

M*/ was once described by Chuck Moore as the most useful arithmetic
operator in Forth.  It is the main workhorse in most computations
involving double-cell numbers.  Note that some systems allow signed
divisors.  This can cost a lot in performance on some CPUs.  The
requirement for a positive divisor has not proven to be a problem.

<P>

M+ is the classical method for integrating.
