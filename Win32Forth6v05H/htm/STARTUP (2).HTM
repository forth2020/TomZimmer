  You are about to embark on a great adventure.  Your intelligence and
  determination will allow you to explore, discover and conquer the
  complex world of Forth in a Windows environment.  Proceed slowly and
  carefully, you don't want to get shot down too often or too quickly,
  and remember that the rewards you receive for your effort, include:
  mastery of the well known, but little understood programming continent,
  called Windows.  But, the fun is in the trip, so enjoy it.  Don't be
  afraid to make mistakes, few of them are likely to be fatal.  Share
  what you learn with others.  Remember that discovery within a group is
  rewarding for everyone in the group.  Don't take this too seriously.

  Win32Forth is a public domain, ANS compatible, Forth language
  application development system.  It was initially written by Andrew
  McKewan, Tom Zimmer, Robert Smith and Jim Schnieder during 1994 and
  1995. Win32Forth is a FAT system, adhering to the phylosophy that if
  some tools are good, many tools must be better.  It includes an
  interactive console and an integrated extensible source level debugger.
  Editing of source text is facilitated by the included WinEd hypertext
  file editor, which allows easy exploration of the many mega-bytes
  of source code that makes up Win32Forth.

  This file contains the bear minimum of information to get you started
  with Win32Forth.  Forth is not inherently a complex language, but when
  it is integrated into a Windows environment, much complexity creeps in.

  I have never been known as a simplist (one who seeks simplicity), but I
  do believe programs should be as simple as possible as long as they
  are not so simple that you can't easily get your job done.

  Basically, when faced with Windows, you can either say: "It is too
  complicated, I won't use it", or you can say: "it is a complex
  environment, I will attempt to master it and bring some order to the
  complexity".  Both of these statments acknowledge that Windows is a big
  ugly creature, but the second statments also acknowledges that there
  may be some value in Windows that can be extracted and used to personal
  advantage.  This is the approach I take, mostly because "Its my job",
  but also because some of the things Windows does are indeed
  interesting.  If you, like me, find something interesting in Windows,
  then follow along.  I can't tell you there won't be any pain or
  pitfalls associated with this little journey, but there will be
  discovery, excitement and lots and LOTS of exploration.

  Win32Forth (including the integrated WinEd editor) is a public domain
  Forth language development system.  That means it is provided without
  support.  As time and inclination permit, I will at times update
  Win32Forth and repair bugs that I decide to fix.  However no warranty
  for usability, reliability, correctness or any other characteristic is
  provided or implied.  If you choose to use Win32Forth for an
  application, either personal or commercial, you assume the
  responsibility for its usability, reliability, correctness and all
  other program characteristics and warranty responsibilities.  Neither
  Thomas Zimmer nor any other contributor to Win32Forth will assume any
  responsibility for its use in any manner.

  I appologize for the need for the previous paragraph, but you do need
  to be warned.

  I should also mention, that the amount of time I have to answer
  questions is quite limited.  You should   post your questions on the
  Forth news group;

        <A HREF=http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&safe=off&group=comp.lang.forth>comp.lang.forth</A> (Web)
  There are lots of people on that news group who love to answer
  questions, and you are likely to get a much quicker answer.  There are
  also several tutorials on Forth available on line, at;

        <A HREF=http://www.forth.org/fig.html>http://www.forth.org/fig.html</A> (Web)
        <A HREF=http://www.forth.org/literature.html>http://www.forth.org/literature.html</A> (Web)
        <A HREF=http://www.forth.org/compilers.html>http://www.forth.org/compilers.html</A> (Web)

  By the way, if you aren't a member of the Forth Interest Group (FIG)
  and you are using Forth, you _should_ be a member.  Win32Forth is free,
  if you like it and believe it provides you some value, then support
  FIG.

  If you find you are not able to use Win32Forth, because of its lack of
  detailed documentation, then you might want to contact a commercial
  vendor at;

        <A HREF=http://www.forth.org/commercial.html>http://www.forth.org/commercial.html</A> (Web)

  These companies are in business to supply Forth systems, and are paid
  to provide documentation and support for your development project.

<A NAME="History"></A><B>History</B>

  Andrew initially wrote the kernel for Win32Forth (mid 1994) in assembly
  language as a personal experiment in the process of bringing up a Forth
  under Microsoft WindowsNT.  Win32Forth uses a (relatively) small
  wrapper or loader written in 'C' that loads the Forth image file and
  executes it. The wrapper provides some limited console I/O to support
  program development.  Andrew also ported (re-wrote actually) the NEON
  OOP (Object Oriented Programming) support to simplify the interface to
  the windows operating system calls.

  In late 1994, Andrew's "baby" kernel was turned over to me (Tom Zimmer)
  for possible use in porting a large data processing application from
  DOS into the WindowsNT environment.  We had looked at and purchased
  what seemed the only available commercial Forth system at the time, but
  unfortunatly it was not yet mature enough to handle our task or needs.
  I ported most of the tools and utilities from my public domain F-PC
  Forth system to Win32Forth to make the application porting task easier.
  The Win32Forth system, derived from Andrew's personal work, and the
  public domain F-PC, has remainded in the public domain

  Jim Schnieder wrote the 486 prefix assembler for Win32Forth, included
  under the GNU public license.  This is the only part of Win32Forth that
  is not truely public domain.  Please read Jim's documents for details
  of its use in commercial applications:

        <A HREF="file:htm\COPYASM.486">COPYASM.486</A>  GNU General Public License version 2, June 1991

  In early 1995, Robert Smith wrote the floating point support for
  Win32Forth.  Robert is very experienced with such tasks, having written
  several floating point packages in the past, including two for F-PC.
  The floating point package includes support for both the eight byte and
  the ten byte floating point formats.

  Win32Forth took a side road into the area of using only absolute
  addresses during 1995, but many problems with compatibility with
  Windows95 and Win32s led me to return to relative addressing as a much
  more portable solution.

  In January 1996, Andrew completed the "F83" style meta-compiler and
  forth source kernel for Win32Forth.  This opened the door to further
  kernel development, including separated heads, and dual dictionaries.

  Version 3.1 released in March 1996, Includes 'Ctrl+F1' help on the ANS
  Forth words described in the DPANS94 document while in the WinView (now
  WinEd) editor. I hypertext compiled the DPANS94 without making any changes
  to the document by extending the hypertext compiler to recognize additional
  search word context.

  This version also has much better compatibility with Win32s running
  under OS/2 and Windows 3.1, due to corrections made to the memory
  management code in the wrapper.

  In May 1996, the sourcelevel debugger interface to the WinView editor
  was completed.  It is now possible to debug a Win32Forth application
  remotely, including; setting breakpoints, single step execution, and
  parameter monitoring.  The requirement to be able to perform these
  operations is that the application be created with the "APPLICATION"
  program save facility rather than the "TURNKEY" facility so that the
  programs symbols are still available for remote debugger control.

  July 1996, Enhancements to windows to allow them to each have their own
  menus, and enhancements to objects to allow the use of a dotted
  notation to access local data within an object.

  An updated version of Jim Schnieder's assembler has also been included
  with this release.

  Compatibility with Win32s under Windows 3.1 and OS/2 has been retained,
  but you should be warned that Microsoft has stopped supporting Win32s
  in their latest version (4.2) of Visual C++.  Future versions of
  Win32Forth may not be compatible with Win32s. I believe the hand
  writing is on the wall.  It is time to start moving off of Windows 3.1
  and onto Windows95 or WindowsNT. I don't know what you users of OS/2
  will do.  If IBM doesn't support the Win32 API directly, then you will
  soon lose access to programs developed for Windows95 and WindowsNT.

  Version 3.2 released July 1996, included enhancements to Windows
  support including separate menus for each application window. Added
  documentation (in the file Win32For.PRV) on how to create a DLL with
  Win32Forth. Added an Optimizer (in the form of OPTIMIZE.F) to
  Win32Forth that allows code sections to be compiled to assembly
  language to improve performance. Fixed various minor bugs in floating
  point number support.  Added data structure support (in the form of
  RECORD:) for use inside classes.  Added dotted notation support to
  classes and sub objects.

  Version 3.3 Released October 1996, includes a new Font class, making
  font manipulation in an application more managable. I have started
  adding HTML support to WinView, so it may evenually be used for
  documentaton. Bill Muench donated multi-tasking support. Additional
  changes were made to enahnce ANS compatibility.  Andrew donated a DLL
  that allowed the removal of over 2000 Windows constants.  The DLL is
  linked into NUMBER, so it can be used to lookup over 8000 Windows
  constants without them having to be in the Forth dictionary.  Extensive
  documentation has been added to FSAVE, TURNKEY and APPLICATION, the
  words used to create programs.

  Version 3.5 Released mid 1997, is primarily a bug fix release, but
  several enhancements to the WinView editor, now allow it to edit
  multiple files in memory at the same time (you need more memory), and I
  have fixed the screen update code, to improve the redisplay
  performance, which several people complained about.

  During most of 1997, and the first half of 1998, Win32Forth took a
  jaunt into the world of commercial Forth systems.  Unfortunately, or
  perhaps fortunately, depending on how you look at it, Win32Forth proved
  to be too large and complex for the commercial vendor to use and
  document. In mid 1998, Win32Forth was restored to myself, and it has
  enjoyed further, though limited development since that time.


<HR>
<A NAME="Architecture"></A><B>Architecture</B>

  Win32Forth is a linear 32bit addressing Forth that uses relative
  addressing within the Forth dictionary.  That is, the Forth dictionary
  always starts at logical address zero (0).  Since Windows95 (or NT)
  will load Win32Forth at whatever address it wants, and will never
  actually load a program at physical address zero, we end up having to
  translate logical addresses to physical addresses when performing calls
  to the operating system.  This is an unfortunate but necessary side
  effect of the fact that Windows does not set aside a predefined area of
  memory exclusively for a user application program to use. The overall
  effect of this design is that addresses passed to and received from the
  operating system must pass through two Forth words; REL>ABS and
  ABS>REL. These two words translate between relative (logical) and
  absolute (physical) addresses. Fortunately most interfacing with the
  operating system is performed at a fairly low level, and as such is
  normally hidden from your application program development.

  In January 1996, Win32Forth had grown to over 5000 words and 550k bytes
  of dictionary, which seemed like a lot of overhead to add to a small
  application program. The solution Andrew came up with was to split the
  forth dictionary architecture into two parts, application and system.
  The Application dictionary holds the "bodies" of all the words that an
  application might need to use at program run-time.  The System
  dictionary holds all the non-application words, like those used only
  during program compile time.  These include vocabularies, windows
  constants (they are compiled as literals),  assembler, disassembler and
  the headers for all the words in both dictionaries.  Using this split
  or dual dictionary architecture reduces a TURNKEYed applications
  overhead by over 200k bytes.  We realize of course that not all
  applications can be turnkeyed, so the old standby FSAVE (from F-PC)
  continues to be provided, so that applications that need full forth
  dictionary access can still be created.  A new program save word
  APPLICATION allows saving programs like TURNKEY, but allows setting the
  amount of free application dictionary and system dictionary space for
  the application to use at runtime.  APPLICATION also saves the program
  with all headers and the system dictionary, so it can be easily
  debugged using the Integrated debugger interface.

<A NAME="Actually Getting Started"></A><B>Actually Getting Started</B>

  Having installed Win32Forth, and gotten to this point, you are probably
  starting to become familiar with the hyper-text editor/browser (and now
  also debugger) integrated into Win32Forth.

  <B>NOTE:</B> If you aren't using the Win32Forth integrated editor called
        WinEd at this moment (look at the title bar of the program you
        are running, it should say WinEd in the upper left corner),
        then you should quit your current editor, start Win32Forth by
        double clicking the Win32Forth icon in the Win32Forth program
        group and Press F1 from within Forth to startup WinEd on this
        file.  The tutorial information following requires you to be
        running WinEd.  If you really can't stand to use WinEd, then
        you can always go back to your own editor later, after trying the
        examples.

  WinEd is an editor written in Forth (source provided in the file
  WinEd.F) and integrated with Win32Forth.  You will see a fairly
  normal looking toolbar at the top of the program window (below the
  menus). The toolbar provides shortcuts to often used operations like;
  Open, Save, Cut, Copy, Paste, Search and HyperText.  If you hold your
  mouse cursor over one of those buttons, you will see a "tooltip" popup
  in a second or so, telling you what the button does.

  If you started WinEd as described above, then Win32Forth is already
  running, and you can click on the Win32Forth window, and then click
  back in the WinEd editor window to continue browsing this file.

  You can edit, print or loada file using the Win32Forth File menu. The
  Display menu allows you to easily display various types of information.
  The Help menu contains entries to various pieces of information
  including a reference to F1 which you used to get to this help file.
  There is also an About menu item you may have looked at, it tells a
  little bit about Win32Forth and the people that have worked on it.

  Forth is really a commandline oriented interactive environment.  Even
  though it is nice to have menus, most of what you will do while
  programming an application requires typing.  If you don't like typing,
  then maybe you are in the wrong line of work (or hobby).  This is also
  probably a good time to mention that Win32Forth was written to match my
  style (or view) of development, that is, it includes tools for
  searching, browsing and exploring.  If you are a reader, and not an
  explorer, then you may have trouble with Win32Forth, since there is
  very limited documentation currently (as in, this file is about it).
  Having said that, Lets try some of the more common utility words to
  help you get a feel for what using Win32Forth is like.

  Click in the Win32Forth console window. Remember, you can always click
  back in the editor window, if you need to scroll to see more of this
  file.  then click back in the console window, to continue typing into
  Forth.

  We will start by looking at the following words;

        <B>WORDS  CONSTANTS  SEE  ORDER  VOCS  V  E  EDIT</B>

  The first word you need to know in Forth is;

        <B>WORDS [substring] [substring]</B>

  WORDS displays all or a set of words from the Forth dictionary.  Since
  Win32Forth has over 4000 functions and over 9000 constants available,
  you can't hope to remember the names and functions of all of them, so
  WORDS allows you to select a set of those words by specifying one or
  two substrings (partial words) following the WORDS command on the Forth
  commandline. You don't have to worry about upper or lower case,
  Win32Forth is case InSeNsItIvE (See note on Calling Windows
  Procedures). Go to the Forth console window and type;

        <B>WORDS ! [enter]</B>

  Forth will display a list of all the words in all vocabularies that
  contain the substring "!".  The word "CONSTANTS" is very similiar to
  "WORDS", except it displays Windows constants that contain one or both
  of the following substrings.  For example, if you type;

        <B>CONSTANTS CR ALPHA</B>

  Then "CONSTANTS" will display the Windows constants shown here;

     ----------- Windows Constants -----------------------------
     IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_SECREL             IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_SECRELHI
     IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_SECRELLO
     -----------------------------------------------------------
     Displayed 3 of the 9462 Windows Constants in the system

  This will prove very valuble when you find yourself trying to remember
  how to spell the name of a needed windows constant.

  Now back to "WORDS".  If you typed the "WORDS" statment as shown
  above, you will see the words "BEEP!" and "+!" listed in the FORTH
  vocabulary.  Go to the Forth window and type;

        <B>SEE BEEP! [enter]</B>

  and then;

        <B>SEE +! [enter]</B>

  You will see that BEEP! is a ":" (colon) definition and "+!" is a CODE
  word that gets disassembled.

  <B>NOTE:</B> As you can see, the decompiler and disassembler display
        information in a form that is close to being re-compilable.  If
        you were to copy a section of the console buffer, you could
        then paste it into a new source file and edit it for
        re-compilation.

  WORDS shows the vocabulary where a word is located, and you must make
  sure the correct vocabulary is selected before using SEE to decompile
  it.  The word that displays the current vocabulary search order is
  ORDER, type;

        <B>ORDER [enter]</B>

  A list of the vocabularies in the search order is displayed.  The
  Context list is the list of vocabularies that is searched, and the
  Current vocabulary is the vocabulary where new definitions are
  compiled.  So for example, if you were to type;

        <B>WORDS CODE [enter]</B>

  You would see a list of words displayed, including the word .CODE
  (pronounced dot code) in the HIDDEN vocabulary.  To see .CODE, you
  would type;

        <B>HIDDEN SEE .CODE [enter]</B>

  To select the hidden vocabulary and then decompile the word .CODE.  If
  you then type ORDER, you will see that the top (left most) entry of the
  vocabulary search order is HIDDEN.

  Lets try another example of CONSTANTS that you may find useful someday,
  type;

        <B>CONSTANTS WM_ [enter]</B>

  You should have seen all of the windows message constants listed.
  These are all of the messages windows can send to an application.
  Don't worry, most of these are handled automatically, you only need to
  handle the ones your application needs to handle in a special way.  All
  of the standard windows constants are kept in the WINCON vocabulary.

  <B>NOTE:</B> You can also notice that the scroll bar at the right of the
        console window allows you to scroll back to the last 500 lines
        displayed in the console window.  This can be very handy for
        looking back at the output of a long debugging session.

  Since we are talking about vocabularies, type;

        <B>VOCS [enter]</B>

  VOCS will display some statistics on all of the vocabularies in
  Win32Forth.  There were 11 vocabularies the last time I looked. The
  VOCS display includes information about the number of HASH threads for
  each vocabulary, the number of words in the vocabulary, and the average
  hash bucket thread depth for the vocabulary.  Win32Forth uses a hashed
  dictionary, with a variable number of hash buckets for each vocabulary
  defined.  As you can probably guess, since most vocabularies have seven
  threads, seven threads is the default number of threads for a
  vocabulary you create. The more threads a vocabulary has, the faster it
  is to search that vocabulary (up to a point).  I typically try to limit
  the average thread depth to between 10 and 20, to assure fast
  compiling, but as you can see some vocabularies (like HIDDEN and
  ASM-HIDDEN) have a large average thread depth.  This is done because
  those vocabularies are not searched very often, and I didn't want to
  waste the space.

  It is useful to note that all vocabulary threads are kept in the SYSTEM
  dictionary, so when you create a TURNKEYed application, the
  vocabularies are thrown away.

  <B>NOTE:</B> in the following section, you will be told to view and edit the
        source for various words in the Win32Forth dictionary.  To return
        to this document after viewing a source file, press Ctrl-PgUp, or
        use the 'Previous Hyper Link' menu item under the 'Hyper' menu.
        If you view or open several files, you may need to press
        Ctrl-PgUp several times to get back to this file.

  You can also View the source for any word in the dictionary, with the
  word 'V' or 'VIEW', used as;

        <B>V DUP [enter]</B>

  If you type the above into the Forth console window, Win32Forth will
  tell WinEd to display the source for DUP.  The editor will dutifully
  open the file FKERNEL.F and display the desired line.  When viewing a
  word, The editor uses BROWSE mode (BLUE left border in the editor) to
  prevent you from accidently changing a source file. Notice the BLUE
  words "Browse Mode" in the toolbar to the right of the toolbar buttons.
  V and VIEW search all vocabularies for the requested word, so the
  vocabulary search order is not important unless you have defined a
  particulary word more than once.  Return here as described in the note
  above.

  The forth word 'E' or 'ED' words like 'V' or 'VIEW' except that WinEd
  is told to enter EDIT mode (CYAN left border) instead of BROWSE mode on
  the requested word. Notice the words "Edit Mode" to the right of the
  toolbar buttons for an unmodified file, and "* MODIFIED *" in RED to
  the right of the toolbar buttons for a file you have changes.

  <B>NOTE:</B> The editor keys Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn can be used to walk
        around between the files you have opened.  WinEd can handle 128
        files opened during an edit session.  You can display a
        selectable list of files opened by draging the vertical splitter
        bar at the left of this window to the right.  This will show the
        list of files currently being edited.  You can move to a file
        that has been opened by clicking on the filename in the list
        window, or by using Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn to move to a desired
        file.  You can close and remove a file from the list by selecting
        the file and then selecting 'Close File' under the 'File' menu.

<A NAME="Debugging Words in Win32Forth"></A><B>Debugging Words in Win32Forth</B>

  Win32Forth includes a debugging facility similiar to the debugger in
  F-PC.  The keys you press however may have changes, so you can use the
  '?' (question mark) key while debugging to see a list of the available
  debugging commands.

  To select a word for debugging, you use the word DEBUG as follows;

        <B>DEBUG WORDS [enter]</B>

  The debugger installs a breakpoint into the first cell of the
  definition WORDS, and waits for WORDS to be executed.  Since we
  haven't executed WORDS yet, nothing more happens.

  <B>NOTE:</B> As soon as you perform the following suggested command, the
        debugger will automatically tell the editor to display the source
        for WORDS.  To return here, use Ctrl-PgUp.

  To get the debugger to start, you need to execute the word where the
  breakpoint is set like this;

        <B>WORDS ! [enter]</B>

  The debugger will be invoked, and it will display the stack on entry to
  WORDS, and the source for WORDS will be displayed in the editor  Return
  here as described in the note above.

  Following the stack display (probably the word 'empty'), you will see
  'const 0' which means CONSTANT with a value of zero.  If you press
  [enter] while the console window is selected, you will see a '[1] 0'
  displayed indicating one stack item with a value of zero.  The debugger
  then displays 'TO WORDS-CNT' which is where the zero is about to be
  stored, into the value WORDS-CNT.  You can press the '?' key at this
  point to see the commands available in the debugger.  Specifically the
  commands 'N' (nest) and 'U' (unnest) are useful for stepping into or
  out of definitions while debugging to get to the point where you can
  see what is really happening in your program.

  Another debugging words is DBG, it works like DEBUG, but it immediately
  invokes the word following. So you need to setup whatever stack
  arguments before using it.  Of course you also need to do this with
  DEBUG as well, before the word being debugged gets executed.  Here is
  an example;

        <B>DBG WORDS ! [enter]</B>

  The debugger starts immediately debugging WORDS, the character '!' is
  passed to WORDS in the input stream as a substring parameter.

  <B>NOTE:</B> The debugger commands are shown here;

        ENTER/SPACE     Single step execute you program
        ESC/Q           Quit, unbug, abort to forth
        . (dot)         Display the depth of the floating point stack
        C               continuous step program execution till key press
        D               Done debugging, run the program to completion
        F               Allow entry of a Forth commandline
        H               Toggle the display of Hex and Decimal numbers
        J               Jump over next Word, useful for exiting LOOPs
        N               Nest into a colon or does> definition
        P               Proceed to initial breakpoint location again
       ^P               Proceed to the current program point again
        R               Show the Return stack functions
        U               Unnest to definition above this one
        V               Display the current vocabulary search order
        W               Allow the entry of watch commands


  <B>NOTE:</B> The words WITHOUT-SOURCE and WITH-SOURCE can be used to turn
        source level debugging off and on respectively.  If you have
        limited memory, you may need to use WITHOUT-SOURCE to turn off
        source level debugging.

<A NAME="Loading Files"></A><B>Loading Files</B>

  Since Win32Forth is ANS Forth compatible, you can use the normal ANS
  words if you are familiar with them to load files, but my favorite file
  load words from F-PC Forth is FLOAD.  It is used as follows;

        <B>FLOAD WINDEMO [enter]</B>

  <B>NOTE:</B> Win32Forth knows that the default file extension for Win32Forth
        files is ".F", so you needn't specify it when loading things from
        the command line of within a file.

  If all went well, the Win32Forth will have loaded WINDEMO.F, and you
  can type the next line to run the demo program;

        <B>WINDEMO [enter]</B>

  If the "\S" near the end of WINDEMO.F is commented out, then an
  application WINDEMO.EXE with its overlay WINDEMO.IMG will have been
  created also.

  <B>NOTE:</B> Since WINDEMO is intended to be a complete program, if you quit
        windemo using its 'File' menu, then Forth will terminate also.
        You can start up Win32Forth again, by opening it in the Program
        Manager.

  Each of the demo programs provided creates a complete program with some
  functionality.  You are welcome to extend them or use them as provided.
  I will be interested in any other demo programs you create, and if I
  think they would be useful to others, I would like to distribute them
  with Win32Forth until I get so many that they have to be distributed as
  a separate archive.

<A NAME="Object Oriented Programming Concepts"></A><B>Object Oriented Programming Concepts</B>

  Win32Forth uses the MOPS metaphor for object oriented programming.
  That is you can define classes which are used to create objects.
  Classes define data which is local to each individual object it
  creates, and methods which are available to all the objects it creates.
  here is an example of a simple class;

        :Class Disk  <Super Object

             int cylinders
             int sectors
             int b/sec
        32 bytes disk-name

        :M ClassInit:   ( -- )
                        0 to cylinders
                        0 to sectors
                        0 to b/sec      ;M

        :M !Attributes: ( cyl sec b/sec -- )
                        to b/sec
                        to sectors
                        to cylinders    ;M

        :M Attributes:  ( -- cyl sec b/sec )
                        cylinders
                        sectors
                        b/sec           ;M

        :M FreeBytes:   ( -- freebytes )
                        cylinders sectors * b/sec * ;M

        ;Class

  Now that we have define the class, we can create an object of the class
  as follows;

        Disk myDisk1
        1024 32 512 !Attributes: myDisk1

  Here we have defined an object called "myDisk", and given this new disk
  the attributes of: cylinders=1024, sectors=32, b/sec=512

  So ":Class" and ";Class" encompass a collection of data items and
  methods that define and identify an object and the way it behaves.
  The word "int" defines a local data item similar to a "value" that is
  local to each object created by a class.  A second data type available
  for use within a class is "bytes", which was used to create a buffer to
  hold the disk name.

  The "ClassInit:" method is special in the sense that it is
  automatically executed right after the object is created.  So it is a
  perfect place to initialize an object to the common default values that
  are shared by all objects of this class.

  Additional methods, (their names always end with a ':' so they can be
  identified as methods) can be defined in your class to initialize,
  display, calculate, or perform whatever type of operation you will need
  to perform on the objects of this class.


<HR>
<A NAME="Creating and Deleting Dynamic Objects"></A><B>Creating and Deleting Dynamic Objects</B>

  So far we have discussed static objects, objects that reside in the
  application dictionary and always consume space.  Another way to create
  objects is to create them dynamically in ALLOCATEd memory.  Win32Forth
  provides a simple way to do this as follows;

        <B>NEW> Disk       ( -- a1 )</B>

  This creates an object of Class Disk, by allocating memory for the
  object.  Forth then executes the ClassInit: method on the object, and
  returns a1 the address of the object on the Windows heap.  The objects
  address can then be saved in a variable, value or array for use later
  in your program.  To execute a method on the object, you need to put
  its address into a variable or value like this.

        0 value DiskObj

        : makeObj  ( -- )
                   NEW> Disk to DiskObj ;

        makeObj                 \ make a Disk Object

        FreeBytes: DiskObj      \ -- freebytes

  You can create as many dynamic objects as you want, within the
  constraints of your available memory.  When you are done with an
  object, you can dispose of it like this;

        DiskObj Dispose         \ dispose of the object
        0 to DiskObj            \ clear the object holder

  It is always a good idea to dispose of any dynamically created object
  once you are done using it.  A special method ~: (tilda colon) the
  destructor, is automatically executed before an object memory is
  released to allow you a chance to do any needed cleanup before the
  objects is destroyed. The ~: method is defined as a noop in Class
  Object, but you can define it as whatever you need when you create a
  new class that will have objects created dynamically.

  If you should happen to forget to dispose of any of the dynamic objects
  you create, before your program terminates, then Forth will
  automatically release their allocated memory at program termination.


<HR>
<A NAME="Calling Windows Procedures"></A><B>Calling Windows Procedures</B>

  Earlier I said the Win32Forth was case insensitive, well thats true
  except when dealing with Windows Procedure calls or with the identical
  condition of calling any external DLL.  When using the CALL word to
  call any DLL procedure, you must match the letter case of the procedure
  you are calling.  For example;

    CALL CreateWindow    \ works the word CALL is not case sensitive
    call CreateWindow    \ works the word CALL is not case sensitive
    Call CreateWindow    \ works the word CALL is not case sensitive

    CALL createwindow    \ won't work, called procedure is case sensitive
    CALL Createwindow    \ won't work, called procedure is case sensitive
    CALL CREATEWINDOW    \ won't work, called procedure is case sensitive

  This choice was made because the name stored in the dictionary is also
  passed to  Windows as the name of the procedure when getting the
  procedures load address.

  When calling Windows procedures, you must pass all parameters to window
  in reverse order to the order specified by any window documentation you
  may have seen.  For example, the Windows MessageBox function is
  defined in the Win32API help as follows;

      int MessageBox(

        HWND     hWnd,      // HANDLE of owner window
        LPCTSTR  lpText,    // address of TEXT in message box
        LPCTSTR  lpCaption, // address of TITLE of message box
        UINT     uType      // STYLE of message box
       );

  In this example, MessageBox receives a handle, two string, then a style
  parameter.  To invoke this function from Win32Forth you must use code
  like the following;

   : ?MessageBox { flag adr len \ message$ -- }
                max-path localAlloc: message$
                flag
                if      adr len message$ place
                        message$ +NULL

                        MB_OK MB_ICONSTOP or  \ message box STYLE
                        z" Notice!" REL>ABS   \ TITLE string
                        message$ 1+ REL>ABS   \ TEXT string
                        CONHNDL               \ parents window HANDLE
                        call MessageBox       \ call the DLL function
                        drop                  \ discard always returned
                                              \ parameter
                then    ;

  Notice that all the parameters are passed in the reverse order in
  which they are specified in the window documentation.  Also notice that
  any address passed to or received from a windows procedure must be
  converted to an absolute address or converted back to a relative
  address for use by Forth.  Finally notice that ALL windows procedure
  calls return a result.  The result may be garbage, but they always
  return something, which you can discard or use as you desire.

<A NAME="Building Contiguous Data Fields in a Class"></A><B>Building Contiguous Data Fields in a Class</B>

  It is sometimes useful to be able to define a series of data objects
  inside a class that will be layed down next to each other in memory.
  This is often useful when you are trying to build a data structure that
  will be passed to a Windows Procedure Call.  Normally Forth lays down
  data items in a class separated by an additonal CELL that holds the
  class pointer for the object.  This makes it easy to decompile and
  debug objects.  If you don't mind limited debugging of a method
  containing the previously described continuous data structure, then you
  can create them in Win32Forth as follows;

  here is an example of a 'C' data structure;

        typedef struct _WIN32_FIND_DATA { 
            DWORD dwFileAttributes;
            FILETIME ftCreationTime;
            FILETIME ftLastAccessTime;
            FILETIME ftLastWriteTime;
            DWORD    nFileSizeHigh;
            DWORD    nFileSizeLow;
            DWORD    dwReserved0;
            DWORD    dwReserved1;
            TCHAR    cFileName[ MAX_PATH ];
            TCHAR    cAlternateFileName[ 14 ];
        } WIN32_FIND_DATA;

  Here is the equivelant Forth Class and data structure that can be used
  to get files from the Windows Directory;


<HR>
        <B>--- Start of Example Code ---</B>

  :Class DirObject <Super Object

        Record: FIND_DATA       \ returns the address of the structure

            int dwFileAttributes
           dint ftCreationTime
           dint ftLastAccessTime
           dint ftLastWriteTime
            int nFileSizeHigh
            int nFileSizeLow
            int dwReserved0
            int dwReserved1
 max-path bytes cFileName
       14 bytes cAlternateFileName

        ;Record

\ Note the instance variable defining words that are used between
\ Record: and ;Record, words like;  int, dint and bytes.  In addition to
\ these data types, Win32Forth now supports;  byte, bits and short.  If
\ you look at the file WINSER.F, you will see an example of the use of
\ these additional data types.  Now we will continue including the source

  This last definition when typed at the Forth commandline, displays a
  list of the *.F files in the current directory;

  <B>NOTE:</B> The above code can be loaded into Win32Forth, by highlighting the
        lines you want to load, and then press Ctrl+C (or use "Copy" in
        the Edit menu) to copy the text, then select the Win32Forth
        onsole window, and press CTRL+V (or use "Paste to Keyboard" in
        the Edit menu) to paste the text into Win32Forth. The lines will
        be pasted one at a time to Win32Forth, which will compile them as
        if you had typed them from the keyboard.  After doing this, just
        type: SIMPLEDIR [enter] you should see the program display a list
        of forth files in the current directory.

<A NAME="Making a New Forth Executable"></A><B>Making a New Forth Executable</B>

  After you have compiled you new program, you will need to create a
  definition that will get executed when the program is first started up.

  Here is an example of the TURNKEY command from WINDEMO.F.  The
  execution address of the Forth application word WINDEMO is passed to
  TURNKEY, which creates WINDEMO.EXE.

  ' WINDEMO TURNKEY windemo[.EXE]

  It is worth while to note a couple of things;

  1. The vocabulary search order will remain the same as it was when the
     TURNKEY was performed.

  2. you must NOT put any vocabulary words in your program initialization
     word if you are TURNKEYing your program, because all of the
     vocabulary words are located in the SYSTEM dictionary, which is
     discarded during the TURNKEY.  Win32Forth will warn you about doing
     this, but if you do it anyway, then your program will surely crash.

  There are three words in Win32Forth that can create new programs, they
  are FSAVE, TURNKEY and APPLICATION.   All of them create new programs
  on your hard drive, though they differ, in the type of program they
  create.  We will cover each in some detail;


  <B>FSAVE</B>  Creates a new copy of Win32Forth on your harddrive, that is a
         duplicate of the Forth you are already running, and will still
         startup running Forth when the new program is executed.  FSAVE
         is followed by the name of the program to create.  The name
         passed to FSAVE must not be the same name as the Forth program
         you are currently running. See notes following.   FSAVE is used
         as follows;

         <B>FSAVE newforth [enter]</B>

         The amount of available dictionary space available will remain
         the same as before FSAVE was performed.  If you need to expand
         the amount of application dictionary or system dictionary space
         available for a subsequent program compile, you can use the
         words;

         <free-bytes> SYS-FREE!   \ set system dictionary free space
         <free-bytes> APP-FREE!   \ set application dictionary free space

         Setting the available dictionary space to a very large value
         will cause slowdowns and possible crashes.  As Win32Forth is
         shipped, you can expand the application dictionary upto a total
         of about one megabyte before it will run into the system
         dictionary.  Use ".FREE" to see the current status of the two
         dictionaries.  If you need to build an applicaiton that will
         have an application dictionary larger than one megabyte, then
         you will need to edit the line in META.F that contains
         SSEPARATION, to a larger value, re-metacompile, re-extend
         Win32Forth, and then fsave a new copy of Win32Forth with an
         APP-FREE! value as large as you require.

         1024 1024 * 1 * VALUE SSEPARATION \ offset from target to heads

         Can be change to something like;

         1024 1024 * 4 * VALUE SSEPARATION \ offset from target to heads

         To increase the separation between the application dictionary
         and the system dictionary to four megabytes.  If you do this,
         you will need machine with at least 32 megabytes of memory.

         You can also reduce somewhat, Win32Forth's memory requirements
         by changing the line to something liek this;

         1024 512 * VALUE SSEPARATION  \ offset from target to heads

         After you re-metacompile and re-extend Win32Forth, the
         separation between the application dictionary and the system
         dictionary will be 512k bytes, leaving about 250k bytes for your
         program. Since Windows 3.1 and O/S2 seem to allocate all of the
         memory from the start of Win32Forth up through the end of the
         system dictionary, doing this might reduce system resource
         requirements significantly.


  <B>TURNKEY</B> Creates an application program that cannot run Forth any
         longer, because all headers are discarded during the program
         save process.  The 'cfa' of a forth definition that runs your
         program must be passed to TURNKEY. TURNKEY reduces the newly
         saved program image size by over 200k bytes. TURNKEYed programs
         cannot be debugged. TURNKEY is followed by the name of the
         program to create. The name passed to TURNKEY must not be the
         same name as the Forth you are currently running. See notes
         following. TURNKEY is used as follows;

         <B>' do-myprogram TURNKEY newprogram [enter]</B>

         TURNKEYed programs always have 3000 bytes of application
         dictionary space available at program startup, and zero bytes of
         system dictionary space available, since all of the system
         dictionary is discarded.

         TURNKEY performs a default form of initialization as shown here;

         : _default-hello ( -- )        \ startup stuff
                        decimal
                        0 to source-id  \ not loading from a file yet
                        init-console    \ -- f1
                        if      initialization-chain do-chain
                        then
                        exception@
                        if      bye
                        then
                        hide-console
                        get-commandline         \ commandline to SOURCE
                        default-application ;

         Your application word 'do-myprogram' as used above, is installed
         into the deferred word DEFAULT-APPLICATION by TURNKEY, so it will
         be run after initialization is completed.  If you need to
         perform some other initialization that shown above, then you
         will need to copy copy the original definition of
         _DEFAULT-HELLO, change it and then install it into the deferred
         word DEFAULT-HELLO.


  <B>APPLICATION</B> Creates an application program  on your harddisk that is
         also fully Forth. The 'cfa' of a forth definition that performs
         any needed program initialization must be passed to APPLICATION.
         APPLICATIONed programs can still be debugged. APPLICATION is
         followed by the name of the program to create. The name passed
         to APPLICATION must not be the same name as the Forth you are
         currently running. See notes following. APPLICATION is used as
         follows;

     <B>4000 4000 ' do-newapplication APPLICATION newapplication [enter]</B>

         The first number is the bytes of application dictionary space
         you want to be available at program startup.  The second number
         is the bytes of system dictionary space you want to be available
         at program startup.

  <B>NOTES:</B> All of the program save words require that a file called
         KERNEL.BIN must be resident in the Win32Forth installation
         directory. KERNEL.BIN is a copy of the file FKERNEL.EXE.
         KERNEL.BIN is copied to the new program you specify as
         "name".EXE, then the Forth image is written to disk either into
         the resource fork of "name".EXE (if you are running WindowsNT),
         or into file "name".IMG (if you are running Windows 3.1 with
         Win32s, or Windows95/98).  The reason the program save works the
         way it does, is because only WindowsNT supports writing into the
         resource of a program, and Windows 3.1 and Windows95 won't allow
         a running program to copy its own executable.  Even worse,
         Widows 3.1 cannot successfully read a user defined resource from
         an executable, so even if you were to create a single file
         executable under WindowsNT, it won't run under Windows 3.1.  For
         this reason, if you are developing programs under WindowsNT
         (like I am), and you want those programs to run under Windows
         3.1 with Win32s, then you must use the WITH-IMG directive before
         using any of these save words, to force the save to create a
         "name".IMG file.

  Well thats about all I have to cover, and I hope it is enough to get
  you started.  There is a lot to learn in Win32Forth, and I believe
  there are enough tools provided to make it possible to learn alot about
  Windows programming.  If you need more, you can always purchase a
  "real" development system.
