<DT><b>ambiguous condition</b>
<DD>The response of a Standard System to an ambiguous condition is left to
the discretion of the implementor.  A Standard System need not
explicitly detect or report the occurrence of ambiguous conditions.
<p>
<DT><b>cross compiler</b>
<DD>Cross-compilers may be used to prepare a program for execution in an
embedded system, or may be used to generate Forth kernels either for the
same or a different run-time environment.
<p>
<DT><b>data field</b>
<DD>In earlier standards, data fields were known as <B>parameter fields</B>.
<P>

On subroutine threaded Forth systems, everything is object code.  There
are no traditional code or data fields.  Only a word defined by 
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.1000>CREATE</a>
or by a word that calls 
CREATE has a data field.  Only a data field
defined via CREATE can be manipulated portably.
<p>
<DT><b>word set</b>
<DD>This Standard recognizes that some functions, while useful in certain
application areas, are not sufficiently general to justify requiring
them in all Forth systems.  Further, it is helpful to group Forth words
according to related functions.  These issues are dealt with using the
concept of word sets.

<P>

The <B>Core</B> word set contains the essential body of words in a Forth
system.  It is the only <B>required</B> word set.  Other word sets
defined in this Standard are optional additions to make it possible to
provide Standard Systems with tailored levels of functionality.</DL>

<H4>A.2.2.2 Stack notation</H4>
</a>

The use of -sys, orig, and dest data types in stack effect diagrams
conveys two pieces of information.  First, it warns the reader that many
implementations use the data stack in unspecified ways for those
purposes, so that items underneath on either the control-flow or data
stacks are unavailable.  Second, in cases where orig and dest are used,
explicit pairing rules are documented on the assumption that all systems
will implement that model so that its results are equivalent to
employment of some stack, and that in fact many implementations do use
the data stack for this purpose.  However, nothing in this Standard
requires that implementations actually employ the data stack (or any
other) for this purpose so long as the implied behavior of the model is
maintained.
