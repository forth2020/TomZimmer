(This foreword is not a part of
American National Standard X3.215-1994)

<P>


Forth is a language for direct communication between human beings and
machines.  Using natural-language diction and machine-oriented syntax,
Forth provides an economical, productive environment for interactive
compilation and execution of programs.  Forth also provides low-level
access to computer-controlled hardware, and the ability to extend the
language itself.  This extensibility allows the language to be quickly
expanded and adapted to special needs and different hardware systems. 

<P>


Forth was invented by Mr.  Charles Moore to increase programmer
productivity without sacrificing machine efficiency.  Forth is a layered
environment containing the elements of a computer language as well as
those of an operating system and a machine monitor.  This extensible,
layered environment provides for highly interactive program development
and testing. 

<P>


In the interests of transportability of application software written in
Forth, standardization efforts began in the mid-1970s by an
international group of users and implementors who adopted the name
<B>Forth Standards Team</B>.  This effort resulted in the Forth-77
Standard.  As the language continued to evolve, an interim Forth-78
Standard was published by the Forth Standards Team.  Following Forth
Standards Team meetings in 1979, the Forth-79 Standard was published in
1980.  Major changes were made by the Forth Standards Team in the
Forth-83 Standard, which was published in 1983. 

<P>


The first meeting of the Technical Committee on Forth Programming
Systems was convened by the Organizing Committee of the X3J14 Forth
Technical Committee on August 3, 1987, and has met subsequently on
November 11-12, 1987, February 10-12, 1988, May 25-28, 1988, August
10-13, 1988, October 26-29, 1988, January 25-28, 1989, May 3-6, 1989,

The purpose of this Standard is to promote the portability of Forth programs
for use on a wide variety of computing systems, to facilitate the
communication of programs, programming techniques, and ideas among Forth
programmers, and to serve as a basis for the future evolution of the Forth
language.

This Standard specifies an interface between a Forth System and a Forth
Program by defining the words provided by a Standard System.

<H3>1.3.1 Word sets</H3>
</a>

This Standard groups Forth words and capabilities into word sets under a name
indicating some shared aspect, typically their common functional area. Each
word set may have an extension, containing words that offer additional
functionality.  These words are not required in an implementation of the word
set.

<P>


The <B>Core</B> word set, defined in sections 1 through 6, contains the
required
words and capabilities of a Standard System.  The other word sets, defined in
sections 7 through 17, are optional, making it possible to provide Standard
Systems with tailored levels of functionality.

<H4>1.3.1.1 Text sections</H4>

Within each word set, section 1 contains introductory and explanatory material
and section 2 introduces terms and notation used throughout the Standard.
There are no requirements in these sections.

<P>


Sections 3 and 4 contain the usage and documentation requirements,
respectively, for Standard Systems and Programs, while section 5 specifies
their labeling.

<a href=htm\dpansa1.htm>Annex A</a> 
provides some of the rationale behind the committee's decisions in
creating this Standard, as well as implementation examples.  It has the same

portable programs.

<H3>1.4.2 Obsolescent features</H3>

This Standard adopts certain words and practices that cause some previously
used words to become obsolescent.  Although retained here because of their
widespread use, their use in new implementations or new programs is
discouraged, because they may be withdrawn from future revisions of the
Standard.
