value, whose scope shall be limited to the definition in which it is
declared, and whose use in a definition shall not preclude reentrancy or
recursion.

<H3>13.3.3 Processing locals</H3>
</a>

To support the locals word set, a system shall provide a mechanism to
receive the messages defined by 
<a href=htm\dpans13.htm#13.6.1.0086>(LOCAL)</a> 
and respond as described here.

<P>

During the compilation of a definition after : 
(<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.0450>colon</a>), 
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.2.0455>:NONAME</a>, or
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a>, 
a program may begin sending local identifier messages to the
system.  The process shall begin when the first message is sent.  The
process shall end when the <B>last local</B> message is sent.  The
system shall keep track of the names, order, and number of identifiers
contained in the complete sequence.

<P>

<hr>
<A name=13.3.3.1>
<H4>13.3.3.1 Compilation semantics</H4>
</a>

The system, upon receipt of a sequence of local-identifier messages,
shall take the following actions at compile time:

<P>

a) Create temporary dictionary entries for each of the identifiers
passed to 
<a href=htm\dpans13.htm#13.6.1.0086>(LOCAL)</a>, 
such that each identifier will behave as a local.
These temporary dictionary entries shall vanish at the end of the
definition, denoted by ; 
(<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.0460>semicolon</a>), 
<a href=htm\dpans15.htm#15.6.2.0470>;CODE</a>, or 
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.1250>DOES></a>.  The system need
not maintain these identifiers in the same way it does other dictionary
entries as long as they can be found by normal dictionary searching
processes.  Furthermore, if the Search-Order word set is present, local
identifiers shall always be searched before any of the word lists in any
definable search order, and none of the Search-Order words shall change
the locals' privileged position in the search order.  Local identifiers
may reside in mass storage.

<P>

b) For each identifier passed to (LOCAL), the system shall generate an
appropriate code sequence that does the following at execution time:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Allocate a storage resource adequate to contain the value of a local.
The storage shall be allocated in a way that does not preclude
re-entrancy or recursion in the definition using the local.
<LI>Initialize the value using the top item on the data stack. If more
than one local is declared, the top item on the stack shall be moved
into the first local identified, the next item shall be moved into the
second, and so on.
</ol>

The storage resource may be the return stack or may be implemented in
other ways, such as in registers. The storage resource shall not be
the data stack. Use of locals shall not restrict use of the data
stack before or after the point of declaration.
<p>

c) Arrange that any of the legitimate methods of terminating execution
of a definition, specifically ; (semicolon), ;CODE, DOES> or 
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.1380>EXIT</a>, will
release the storage resource allocated for the locals, if any, declared
in that definition.  
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.0670>ABORT</a> 
shall release all local storage resources,
and 
<a href=htm\dpans9.htm#9.6.1.0875>CATCH</a> / 
<a href=htm\dpans9.htm#9.6.1.2275>THROW</a> 
(if implemented) shall release such resources for all
definitions whose execution is being terminated.

<P>

d) Separate sets of locals may be declared in defining words before
DOES> for use by the defining word, and after DOES> for use by the word
defined.

<P>

A system implementing the Locals word set shall support the declaration
of at least eight locals in a definition.

<P>

<H4>13.3.3.2 Syntax restrictions</H4>
</a>

Immediate words in a program may use 
<a href=htm\dpans13.htm#13.6.1.0086>(LOCAL)</a> to implement syntaxes for
local declarations with the following restrictions:

<P>

a) A program shall not compile any executable code into the current
definition between the time (LOCAL) is executed to identify the first
local for that definition and the time of sending the single required
<B>last local</B> message;

<P>

b) The position in program source at which the sequence of (LOCAL)
messages is sent, referred to here as the point at which locals are
declared, shall not lie within the scope of any control structure;

<P>

c) Locals shall not be declared until values previously placed on the
return stack within the definition have been removed;

<P>

d) After a definition's locals have been declared, a program may place
data on the return stack.  However, if this is done, locals shall not be
accessed until those values have been removed from the return stack;

<P>

e) Words that return execution tokens, such as ' 
(<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.0070>tick</a>), 
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.2510>[']</a>, or 
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.1550>FIND</a>,
shall not be used with local names;

<P>

f) A program that declares more than eight locals in a single definition
has an environmental dependency;

<P>

g) Locals may be accessed or updated within control structures,
including do-loops;

<P>

h) Local names shall not be referenced by 
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.2033>POSTPONE</a> and 
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.2.2530>[COMPILE]</a>.

        Execution: ( c-addr u -- )
</pre>
<P>

When executed during compilation, (LOCAL) passes a message to the system
that has one of two meanings.  If u is non-zero, the message identifies
a new local whose definition name is given by the string of characters
identified by c-addr u.  If u is zero, the message is <B>last local</B>
and c-addr has no significance.

<P>

The result of executing (LOCAL) during compilation of a definition is to
create a set of named local identifiers, each of which is a definition
name, that only have execution semantics within the scope of that
definition's source.

<PRE>
        <i>local</i> Execution: ( -- x )
</PRE>
<P>

Push the local's value, x, onto the stack.  The local's value is
initialized as described in 
<a href=htm\dpans13.htm#13.3.3>13.3.3</a> Processing locals and may be changed
by preceding the local's name with 
<a href=htm\dpans13.htm#13.6.1.2295>TO</a>.  An ambiguous condition exists
when local is executed while in interpretation state.
<p>

<b>Note:</b> This word does not have special compilation semantics in
the
usual sense because it provides access to a system capability for use
by other user-defined words that do have them.  However, the locals
facility as a whole and the sequence of messages passed defines
specific usage rules with semantic implications that are described in
detail in section 
<a href=htm\dpans13.htm#13.3.3>13.3.3</a> Processing locals.

<P>

<b>Note:</b> This word is not intended for direct use in a definition to
declare that definition's locals.  It is instead used by system or
user compiling words.  These compiling words in turn define their own
syntax, and may be used directly in definitions to declare locals.  In
this context, the syntax for (LOCAL) is defined in terms of a sequence
of compile-time messages and is described in detail in section 
<a href=htm\dpans13.htm#13.3.3>13.3.3</a> Processing locals.

<b>Note:</b> The Locals word set modifies the syntax and semantics of
