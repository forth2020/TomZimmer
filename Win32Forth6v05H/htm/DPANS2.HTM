<H1>2. Terms, notation, and references</H1>

The phrase <B>See:</B> is used throughout this Standard to direct the reader to
other sections of the Standard that have a direct bearing on the current
section.

<P>

In this Standard, <B>shall</B> states a requirement on a system or
program; conversely, <B>shall not</B> is a prohibition; <B>need not</B>
means <B>is not required to</B>; <B>should</B> describes a
recommendation of the Standard; and <B>may</B>, depending on context,
means <B>is allowed to</B> or <B>might happen</B>.

<P>

Throughout the Standard,
typefaces are used in the following manner:

<UL>
<LI>This proportional
serif typeface is used for text, with italic used
for symbols and the first appearance of new terms;
<LI>A bold
proportional sans-serif typeface is used for headings;
<LI>A bold
monospaced serif typeface is used for Forth-language text.
</UL>

<H2>2.1 Definitions of terms</H2>
</a>

Terms defined in this section are used generally throughout this Standard.
Additional terms specific to individual word sets are defined in those word
sets.  Other terms are defined at their first appearance, indicated by italic
type.  Terms not defined in this Standard are to be construed according to the
Dictionary for Information Systems, ANSI X3.172-1990.

<H3>2.2.1 Numeric notation</H3>

Unless otherwise stated, all references to numbers apply to signed single-cell
integers.  The inclusive range of values is shown as {from...to}.  The
allowable range for the contents of an address is shown in double braces,
particularly for the contents of variables, e.g., 
<a href=htm\dpans6.htm#6.1.0750>BASE</a> {{2...36}}.

<H3>2.2.2 Stack notation</H3>
</a>

Stack parameters input to and output from a definition are described using the
notation:


<PRE>

( stack-id  before -- after )

</PRE>

<P>

where stack-id specifies which stack is being described, before represents the
stack-parameter data types before execution of the definition and after
represents them after execution.  The symbols used in before and after are
shown in 
<a href=htm\dpans3.htm#table.3.1>table 3.1</a>.

<P>

The control-flow-stack stack-id is <B>C:</B>, the data-stack stack-id is
<B>S:</B>, and the return-stack stack-id is <B>R:</B>.  When there is no
confusion, the data-stack stack-id may be omitted.

<P>

When there are alternate after representations, they are described by
<B>after1 | after2</B>.  The top of the stack is to the right.  Only
those stack items required for or provided by execution of the
definition are shown.

If, in addition to using stack parameters, a definition parses text,
that text is specified by an abbreviation from table 2.1, shown
surrounded by double-quotes and placed between the before parameters and
the <B>--</B> separator in the first stack described, e.g.,
