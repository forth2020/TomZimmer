<H2>A.7 The optional Block word set</H2>

Early Forth systems ran stand-alone, with no host OS.  Blocks of 1024
bytes were designed as a convenient unit of disk, and most native Forth
systems still use them.  It is relatively easy to write a native disk
driver that maps head/track/sector addresses to block numbers.  Such
disk drivers are extremely fast in comparison with conventional
file-oriented operating systems, and security is high because there is
no reliance on a disk map.

<P>

Today many Forth implementations run under host operating systems,
because the compatibility they offer the user outweighs the performance
overhead.  Many people who use such systems prefer using host OS files
only; however, people who use both native and non-native Forths need a
compatible way of accessing disk.  The Block Word set includes the most
common words for accessing program source and data on disk.

<P>

In order to guarantee that Standard Programs that need access to mass
storage have a mechanism appropriate for both native and non-native
implementations, ANS Forth requires that the Block word set be available
if any mass storage facilities are provided.  On non-native
implementations, blocks normally reside in host OS files.

<DD>Many Forth systems use blocks to contain program source.  Conventionally
such blocks are formatted for editing as 16 lines of 64 characters.
Source blocks are often referred to as <B>screens</B>.</DL>
