In order to assure that your application can find the Win32For IMG and DLL
without loading your already weary WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory it is recommended
that you set your environment to include the directory where you just
installed your new Win32Forth package.

This will involve adding the following line to AutoExec.Bat.

        PATH=%PATH%;C:\Win32For

If you did not install in the default directory, modify the path and use the
new string in your AutoExec.BAT file.  You can highlight the text with your
mouse (or shift key and cursor keys) and you can copy and paste it into
AutoExec.Bat (ALT-2).

See the [Edit] menu up top for more information if you need it.

you need to, you can click on Edit_Autoexec.EXE to run this program again
later.
